"""Shared test helpers for the Cortex API test suite.

E006 Inc04 (Roster-as-Data) made the writer guard registry-driven: every write/
handoff endpoint now calls the async ``load_roster_policy(project)`` resolver,
which issues two reads —

  1. ``SELECT metadata FROM cortex_projects WHERE project_key=$1 ...``  (admin pool)
  2. ``SELECT lower(name), capabilities->>'writer_scope', role FROM agents a ...``
     and ``... FROM roles ...``                                         (scoped pool)

Tests that drive a guard-protected endpoint through a hand-rolled fake connection
need to answer those reads. The helpers below provide the seeded-kaidera-os answers
(work writers {kai,ren}; system writers {beat,migration,system}) so a fake Conn
can delegate to them in its ``fetchrow``/``fetch`` dispatch before falling back to
its own ``AssertionError``. This keeps the registry shape defined in exactly one
place and behaviour-preserving for the existing endpoint tests.

The dedicated guard tests (test_kaidera_os_writer_guard / test_agent_name_guard /
test_roster_as_data) deliberately DO NOT use these — they exercise the real
resolver against their own fixtures to prove the data path.
