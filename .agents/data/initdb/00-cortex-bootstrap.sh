# Cortex DB bootstrap — runs ONCE on a fresh cortex-pg (empty data volume), via the
# Postgres docker-entrypoint-initdb.d hook. On an EXISTING volume (this Mac) it never
# runs, so it can't disturb live agent memory.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: Kaidera OS can be installed from a fresh archive, and the
# pre-2026-05-08 migrations that built the Cortex base schema (the `project` columns,
# agent_profiles, agent_diaries, …) did NOT come across — so the repo's schema.sql +
# remaining migrations can't rebuild a working DB from scratch. cortex-api opens its app
# pool AS cortex_app at startup, so without provisioning the role + a COMPLETE schema the
# API crashes on boot ("role cortex_app does not exist" / missing relations) and the
# console reports "can't find Cortex".
#
# cortex-schema-full.sql is the exact, complete current schema captured (schema-only, zero
# rows) from the running cortex-pg: Identity v2 actor tables, work products, migrations,
# indexes, grants, and RLS. It is the authoritative source of truth for a fresh deploy.
# Regenerate it whenever the live schema changes:
#   docker exec cortex-pg pg_dump -U postgres -d platform_agent_memory \
#       --schema-only --no-owner > .agents/data/cortex-schema-full.sql
#
# ON_ERROR_STOP=1 + set -e: fail LOUD. A half-provisioned Cortex DB must not come up
# looking healthy — better the container refuses to start so the gap is obvious.

# 1. Roles FIRST — the schema's GRANTs + RLS policies reference them, and cortex-api's

#    only) + cortex_app_test (test fixtures) are referenced by the dump's grants and must
#    exist for it to apply. Local default passwords match the role name; a hardened deploy
#    overrides via ALTER ROLE + a secret.
